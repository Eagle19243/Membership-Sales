                                you’re out fishing and your favorite beer or beverage is 
                                calling your name from the ice chest. <br><br>

                                You’re dying to take a refreshing drink but twisting off 
                                those ice cold bottle caps can be a pain and 
                                you forgot a bottle opener! <br><br>

                                Not to worry! <br><br>

                                You can quickly and easily pull out your Concealed Knife 
                                and pop the top off that bottle faster than 
                                you can say “Boy, am I thirsty.”.

                                First, the more members we have the lower our cost per member to deliver all 
                                the Club’s training, news updates, free gear, and other benefits. 
                                That’s pretty obvious.<br><br>

                                But, the second – and maybe bigger reason – is that 
                                <span class="b-600">
                                our numbers make our members very valuable to big companies 
                                that want our (the FSGC) help.
                                </span><br><br>

                                If you remember what we said earlier, these companies develop and 
                                build resources you use all the time like tactical gear, 
                                survival supplies, courses, books and more.<br><br>

                                They want people to test their products and provide feedback and ideas.<br><br>

                                Of course, when you get a product you really like, 
                                they’re hoping you’ll tell other people about that product 
                                so they’ll get free word of mouth promotion.<br><br>

                                <span class="b-600">
                                That’s why they make free gear available to the members of the 
                                “Free Survival Gear Club”!

                                You have to admit, compared to the value you get, 
                                the membership dues are miniscule.
